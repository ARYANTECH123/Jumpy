# Jumpy
A simple 2d movement demonstration using olc::PGE anf c++.
It uses [oneLoneCoder Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine), which is under the OLC3 Licence.

# How to run
If the `a.exe` does not work properly, you may have to compile it yourself.
Before trying to compile, you should make sure that your compiler is set up corrctly. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/wiki) to set up your compiler.
For Windows, with `g++`(MSYS2), you can clone the folder, extract, and run `./build main.cpp` in PowerShell or CMD.

## What can you do
Use arrow keys to move. You can mess with the simulation parameters like friction, and gravity to get a feel for what it feels like. Go wild!
